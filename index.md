I'm a lapsed mathematician sneaking his way into neuroscience. I'm interested in the neural correlates of psychedelic states and the OpenWorm project.

----------------

I'm currently studying an MSc Psychology Conversion course (2019-2020) at the University of Reading. I was a workshop participant at the [Neuroscience Data Challenge 2019](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/neural-dynamics/information/neuroscience-data-challenge/) at the University of Bristol, where my group was tasked with analysing a dataset from a [behavioural experiment](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/01/04/182246.full.pdf) on working memory in rats. Prior to this, I read Mathematics at Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford (2007-2011). I was also, for a time, a member of a [progressive death metal band](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ageless+oblivion) (2012-2014). I currently tutor mathematics up to university level in central Reading (2014-present).

This page is new (updated 18th September 2019), so there isn't much here at the moment. More exciting stuff will be added soon!

GitHub Pages are a great way to showcase some open source projects, host a blog, or even share your résumé. This guide will help get you started on creating your next website. 
## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sperinck/sperinck.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sperinck/sperinck.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
