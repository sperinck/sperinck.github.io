# Fahad Sperinck

I'm a lapsed mathematician sneaking his way into neuroscience. I'm interested in the neural correlates of psychedelic states and the OpenWorm project.

I'm currently studying an MSc Psychology Conversion course (2019-2020) at the University of Reading. Prior to this, I read Mathematics at Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford (2007-2011). I was also, for a time, a member of a [progressive death metal band](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ageless+oblivion).
