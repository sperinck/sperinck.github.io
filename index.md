I'm a lapsed mathematician sneaking his way into neuroscience. I am interested in the neural correlates of psychedelic states and the OpenWorm project. Currently I'm an MSc Psychology student at the University of Reading. Prior to this I was an MMath at Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford.

GitHub Pages are a great way to showcase some open source projects, host a blog, or even share your résumé. This guide will help get you started on creating your next website. 
## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/sperinck/sperinck.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sperinck/sperinck.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
