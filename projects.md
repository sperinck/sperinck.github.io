## Using machine learning methods to classify MRI data
During the summer of 2019, I worked on an independent project to apply machine learning classification methods to open-source structural MRI data. Specifically, I trained a support vector machine to classify brains by gender, based only on morphometric data. The SVM was implemented in R, and the data came from the Human Connectome Project. The SVM had a balanced accuracy of over 80% and a sensitivity of 95%.

The book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James was indispensable as a resource on how to apply this in practice. For anyone interested in doing something like this, I will put up more details soon. It was mainly to teach myself the basics of properly coding and training an SVM.

## Project Euler
See [here](projects/euler.md) for my solutions to some Project Euler problems, in Python and C++.  

<sub>*N.B. I am still a novice at C++. Though I don't like the syntax compared to the ease of Python, I am pushing past this in the vague hope that there will be some future reward...*</sub>
