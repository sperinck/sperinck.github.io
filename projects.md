## Using machine learning methods in fMRI
During the summer of 2019, I worked on an independent project to apply machine learning classification methods to open-source fMRI data. Specifically, I trained a support vector machine to classify brains by gender, based only morphometric data. The SVM was implemented in R, and the data came from the Human Connectome Project. The book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* by Gareth James was indispensable as a resource on how to apply this in practice. 

## Project Euler
See [here](projects/euler.md) for my solutions to some Project Euler problems, in Python and C++.
