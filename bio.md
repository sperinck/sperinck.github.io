I'm currently studying an MSc Psychology Conversion course at the University of Reading. My dissertation is an EEG trial comparing the brain activity of expert knitters just after knitting to expert meditators. 

I was a workshop participant at the [Neuroscience Data Challenge 2019](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/neural-dynamics/information/neuroscience-data-challenge/) at the University of Bristol, where my group was tasked with analysing a dataset from a [behavioural experiment](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/01/04/182246.full.pdf) on working memory in rats.

I'm interested in how various pathologies find their initial expression in neural activity - how a better understanding of that activity can lead us to find better interventions, such as using psychedelic drugs to treat anxiety and depression. I am also interested in computational models of simple nervous systems, such as *C. Elegans*, and the growing body of work in the OpenWorm project. You can find some things I am working on the [Projects](/projects) page.
