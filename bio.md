## Bio
I'm currently studying an MSc Psychology Conversion course (2019-2020) at the University of Reading. I was a workshop participant at the [Neuroscience Data Challenge 2019](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/neural-dynamics/information/neuroscience-data-challenge/) at the University of Bristol, where my group was tasked with analysing a dataset from a [behavioural experiment](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/01/04/182246.full.pdf) on working memory in rats. Prior to this, I read Mathematics at Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford (2007-2011). I was also, for a time, a member of a [progressive death metal band](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=ageless+oblivion) (2012-2014). I currently tutor mathematics up to university level in central Reading (2014-present).
