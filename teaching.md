## Teaching
I tutor mathematics from GCSE to University-level in the heart of Reading. I provide a non-judgmental, welcoming atmosphere in which to learn and enrich your maths abilities. Mathematics at every level is often about how much you feel you can do, as well as how much knowledge you actually have. It is also, like many other skills, a practiced art. No one is born good at it! Yet just about everyone has the capacity to excel in mathematics with the right guidance.

I have 10+ years experience in maths tuition, teaching a range of ages from 10 to 48. I read Mathematics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. I have taught in London, Oxford, and Reading over the last decade, and I am currently an examiner and author in Further Mathematics for OCR.

Currently, I am fully booked up for the academic year 2019-2020. If you are interested in having lessons, you can check back again later or email me to be put on the waiting list.
